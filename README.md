# Why Use This Tool <a name = "why_use_this_tool"></a>

If you're a lab scientist and/or work in pathology you would be used to viewing blood slides to assess which type of Malaria the patient may have so the patient can get the right treatment.

Sometimes you may get either a Country Name or Country Code of where the patient is from / has recenlty come from and may take a long time to lookup the country and see which malaria type is more prevalent. You can enter either the country name OR country code and this toll will still display results.

- Fast - Get Malaria types and their likeliness in seconds.
- Easy To Use - Can enter country name OR country code. And if you dont feel like using a GUI, then there is even an even easier to use [CLI Version Here!](https://github.com/JamesWRC/MDT_Lite)
- Simple - Just type in a countrys name or code and the likeliness of each Malaria type is displayed in a nice orderly fassion.
- Easy to set up
